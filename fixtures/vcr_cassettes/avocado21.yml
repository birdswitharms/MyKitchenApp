        Blend all the mousse ingredients together in your food processor until smooth.
        Add the cacao powder first and, as you blend, have all the ingredients to
        hand in order to adjust the ratios slightly as the size of avocados and bananas
        varies so much. The perfect ratio in order to avoid the dish tasting too much
        of either is to use equal amounts of both.\r\n\r\n2. Taste and add a few drops
        of stevia if you feel you need more sweetness.\r\n\r\n3. Fill little cups
        or shot glasses with the mousse, sprinkle with the cacao powder or nibs and
        serve.\r\n\r\nTip If you don\u2019t have a frozen banana to hand you can just
        use a normal one and then chill the mousse before serving for a cooling dessert.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/uttuxy1511382180.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wuZffe60q4M","strIngredient1":"Banana","strIngredient2":"Cacao","strIngredient3":"Avocado","strIngredient4":"Honey","strIngredient5":"Lemon
