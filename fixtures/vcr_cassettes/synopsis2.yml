        oven to 140C\/120C fan\/gas 1. Put a large ovenproof pan (with a tight-fitting
        lid) on a high heat. Add your fat and diced meat, cook for a few mins to seal
        the edges, giving it a quick stir to cook evenly. Reduce the heat to low,
        add the sliced onion, whole garlic cloves, carrot and fennel seeds, and cook
        gently to soften the veg for a few mins.\r\nPour over the red wine vinegar,
        scraping any meaty bits off the bottom of the pan. Add the stock, tomato pur\u00e9e,
        and half the rosemary and parsley. Bring to the boil and simmer for 10 mins,
        then season, cover with a lid and put into the oven for 2 hrs, removing the
        lid for the final hour of cooking. Stir occasionally and add the beans with
        30 mins to go.\r\nRemove the pan from the oven and heat the grill. Scatter
        the top with the remaining herbs and breadcrumbs, drizzle a little oil over
        the top, and return to the oven for 5-10 mins, until the breadcrumbs are golden.
        Serve with crusty bread and green veg.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/wxuvuv1511299147.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MEdHMTD0VCA","strIngredient1":"Goose

        the uncooked pork thinly, about \u215b\". It helps to slightly freeze it (optional).\r\nMince
        garlic and shallots. Mix in a bowl with sugar, fish sauce, thick soy sauce,
        pepper, and oil until sugar dissolves.\r\nMarinate the meat for 1 hour, or
        overnight for better results.\r\nBake the pork at 375F for 10-15 minutes or
        until about 80% cooked. Finish cooking by broiling in the oven until a nice
        golden brown color develops, flipping the pieces midway.\r\nAssemble your
        bowl with veggies, noodles, and garnish. Many like to mix the whole bowl up
        and pour the fish sauce on top, but I like to make individual bites and sauce
        it slowly.","strMealThumb":"https:\/\/www.themealdb.com\/images\/media\/meals\/qqwypw1504642429.jpg","strTags":null,"strYoutube":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q3qcQcENzbU","strIngredient1":"Pork","strIngredient2":"Rice
